## How to install all related packages (assuming you have already setup react native and expo)

### 1. Clear your npm cache

`npm cache clean --force`

 ### 2. Delete package-lock.json
 This removes the file that tracks all your currently stored packages 
 
`rm -rf package-lock.json`

 ### 3. Delete node_modules directory

`rm -rf node_modules`

### 4. Install all packages 

`npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

NOTE: The --legacy-peer-deps flag helps get around conflicting packages
